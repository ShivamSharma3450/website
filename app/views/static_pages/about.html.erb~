It would be greatly appreciated if you take part in any of our fundraising schemes, as each person must raise the Â£3125 required for the expedition to Botswana.

You are not only helping the people going, but the local people and wildlife of Botswana. You are providing those who are going with a once in a lifetime educational experience that they could not receive sat at a classroom table.  

the trip/expedition will last approximately 16 days. during this time there will be various events taking place. These will depend on the itinery selected by participants of the groups, however it will include helping with a white rhino conservation.
